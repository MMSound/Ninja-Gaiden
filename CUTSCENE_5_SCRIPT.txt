ENGLISH

After getting back the
demon statue, I felt
a strange premonition
and hurried back.

"Dr. Smith!!"

"Ryu... the "LIGHT"
 demon statue ...
 was taken..."

"The "LIGHT" statue?"

"Yes, your father and I
 ... we each kept one of
 the statues... just in
 case.

"So that the two statues
 would never become one.

"The demon's been asleep
 for 700 years ... and now
 it's starting to wake up

"...whatever we do...
 we've got to stop it.

"Got to get it back...
 there's no choice...
 you've got to become
 the Ninja Dragon..."

"Dr. Smith! Dr. Smith!"

"..."

"Come with us."
