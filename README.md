# Ninja-Gaiden
This is a fan-made remake of Ninja Gaiden for the NES. 
All assets and programming are either by MiniMacro Sound (unless otherwise specified) or borrowed and edited from the Ninja Gaiden NES games by Tecmo.

If you are paying money for this in any way, you've been scammed.

Default controls are as follows:
Jump - Z
Slash - X
Weapon - (Up + Slash) or C
Up/Down/Left/Right - Arrow keys
Start - Enter
Select - Shift
These can be rebound in the game's options menu.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
If you get the "shader warning" screen upon starting the game, ensure that your DirectX runtimes are completely updated to the most recent version.
This game makes very heavy use of shaders and there are numerous effects that rely on them. You can still play the game completely without it, but it won't look quite as cool.

Created using GameMaker Studio 2 by YoYo Games.
