{Welcome, Ryu Hayabusa.
 Sorry if I startled
 you.{

{We are from the CIA
 Special Auxiliary unit.
 My name's Foster.{

{...{

{Getting right to the
 point...{

{Wait. I want to knw
 why you killed Smith?{

{We didn't kill him.
 But we'll fill you in
 on what we do know.{

{In the upper reaches of
 the Amazon, some
 ancient ruins were
 discovered.

{It seems the temple was
 built more than 2000
 years ago.

{The discoverer was Dr.
 Smith, who studied the
 ruins for some time.

{But one day, he
 suddenly sealed off the
 ruins.

{And ever since then
 no one has gone close.

{Later, however, a man
 moved in and took over
 the ruins. His name is
 Guardia de Mieux.

{He calls himself
 the Jaquio.

{According to our
 records, it seems that

{the temple is not where
 gods are worshipped but
 was built to imprison
 the body of the demon.

{Therefore, evil spirits
 are supposed to be held
 in the statue you have.

{Dr. Smith probably
 already knew that.

{He was probably killed
 by someone working for
 the Jaquio.

{...{

{When a black moon
 shines, Light and Dark
 break apart, the King
 of Darkness howls.{

{These were the last
 words written on the
 stone tablet.

{If someone brings the
 demon back to life, he
 will gain incredible
 power...

{Enough to control the
 entire world.{

{So you know about that?{

{The woman who shot you
 in the bar was one of
 our agents.{

{They are after you.

{Use this and go to
 their headquarters.
 Get the demon statue
 back from them.

{Of course, you will be
 paid for the work.{

{And if I say no?{

{You know the answer to
 that.{
