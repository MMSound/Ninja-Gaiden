{Who is it?{

{You must be\n Walter Smith.\n The name's Ryu.\n Ryu Hayabusa.{

{Who? That sword...\n Of course. You must be\n Ken Hayabusa's son.{

{In his last letter,\n my father told me\n I should see you.{

{Last letter? I see ...\n So it is already begun.{

{...{

{Ken and I were on an\n expedition to some old\n Amazon ruins.{

{We found a strange \n statue and stone tablet.\n On the tablet, it said..{

{Wait a minute. You mean\n to tell me that\n statue ...{

{Yes, precisely.\n I thought it had been\n stolen.

{That demon statue\n possesses nough evil\n power to destroy an\n entire nation.

{The demon came to this\n earth and caused many\n deaths.

{But then SHINOBI\n appeared to stop the\n demon.

{SHINOBI borrowed the\n strength of the dragon

{and countered each of\n the demon's spells and\n thus was able to\n overcome it.

{Yet, though it was\n defeated, the demon was\n not dead.

{So SHINOBI confined the\n evil power of the demon\n in two statues\n of "LIGHT" and "SHADOW".

{...And the body of the\n demon was confined in a\n temple.

{This one must be the\n "SHADOW" statue.\n Therefore....{

{And now I've got it.\n Bye, friend!{

{What the ... ?{

{After him, Ryu!{
